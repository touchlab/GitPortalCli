# GitPortalCli

This is the public repo hosting dependencies to build GitPortal with Homebrew. 

## GitPortal

GitPortal is a purpose-built tool to share code across repos. It's specific purpose is to facilitate teams adopting KMP use local source code instead of publishing binaries.

## More Info

## Where's the code?

Coming soon. GitPortal is under fairly heavy development, and will likely go through some refactoring and cleanup before making source available. It's not a complex tool, in its current form. You can see what git operations it is executing by configuring the log levels when running gitportal.
